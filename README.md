## Motivation

#### Poverty and Pollution in Tennessee aims to examine the effects of lead exposure on the people of Tennesse, and identify any disparities in the quality-of-life and effectiveness of government intervention between high-risk and low-risk counties.

#### This deep dive with a chance encounter with an old friend at the hardware store. We were catching up and I mentioned that I had just recently purchased my first home in an area of Chattanooga called East Lake, at which point he told me that the neighborhood I lived in was part of something called a "Superfund site" and that I should ask the EPA to come out and test my soil for lead. I filed the request as soon as I got home, and then spent the next several absorbing every piece of information I could find about lead and the consequences of lead exposure.

#### I learned about the ubiquity of lead-use all throughout human history, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the terrible effects even the smallest levels of exposure can have on the body. It's especially disasterous for children, for whom both prenatal and postpartum exposure can lead to behavior problems, lower IQ, cognitive dysfunction, hearing loss, and even death. Knowing our country's history of class inequality and redlining, I've long suspected that East Lake isn't the only low-income area of Tennessee being under-served in the area of lead mitigation and abatement and I was eager for the opportunity to analyze the data in order to find out.

## Technologies

#### The vast majority of my analysis was completed in Excel and Tableau, with some additional analysis of the distribution of EPA Superfund sites completed using Python 3 and Jupyter Noterbook. The final presentation was completed in PowerPoint.

## Problems and Hurdles

#### The key metric of my analysis was the EBLL, or Elevated Blood Lead Levels. Every year, the Tennessee Department of Health performs blood lead level testing for a selection of children under 6 in all 95 Tennessee counties. When an EBLL meeting or exceeding 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, it's logged in the DOH's own internal database in addition to the CDC and The University of Tennessee's LeadTRK system.
